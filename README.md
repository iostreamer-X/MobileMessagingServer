#MobileMessagingServer

I built a full chat system for one of my labs and this is the backend code for it.
The android app code resides [here](https://github.com/iostreamer-X/MobileMessagingAndroid).

The Server requires MongoDB because that's the database I have used. It was a good experience
working on it. The json format was really cool.

To start the server,
```shell
node index.js
```
